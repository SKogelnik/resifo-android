###Postmortem

#####Coding
Many hours were wasted on code that had already been written a thousand times by other people.
Searching for solutions is most often a quicker and more efficient approach when solving trivial problems.

This was also one of the reasons for chosing Java over Scala.
Even with no experience in Java it was easier to get running prototypes with the help of the internet.

#####Time Management

This was our first project as a team. Therefore we didnt know exactly who could do which tasks.
The smart thing to do would have been talking about skills before starting.
It worked out fine in the end because we are awesome.

#####Bugs and Testing

We didnt waste a lot of time on finding bugs. User Input is not checked for sanity,
so we dont really know what happens if your name has 999 characters.


#####Usability

Our prototype was very functional with no intentions of beeing userfriendly.
Towards the end we decided to use some colours and fancy buttons,
which promptly crashed the app.
Next time we should think about design first and/or get someone who likes colours and buttons.
